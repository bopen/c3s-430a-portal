This Index is part of the Biochemical ocean properties type of the Oceanic category of the classification. \nA higher/lower index value indicates higher/lower acidity and thus lower/higher risk. Today, ocean water is normally slightly basic, with a surface-water pH of about 8.1.</p>\n<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>\n<p>The Ocean pH Level index (dimensionless) is the seawater pH at a certain depth.\npH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. The more hydrogen ions that are present, the more acidic is the solution. The pH scale ranges from zero (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). The  scale is logarithmic, meaning a single unit corresponds to a ten-fold difference. A pH of 7 is neutral, a pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. </p>\n<p><strong>Data Sources</strong> </p>\n<p>The simulated index data are from the <a href=\"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-marine-properties?tab=overview\">Marine biogeochemistry data for the Northwest European Shelf and Mediterranean Sea from 2006 up to 2100 derived from climate projections</a> dataset. The dataset contains a set of projected changes in marine physics and biogeochemical variables used to infer climate change indicators, as well as changes in the lower trophic levels (plankton) of the marine food web. Two sets of simulations were produced with the ERSEM ecosystem model coupled with two circulation models (POLCOMS and NEMO) over two different domains (pan european for POLCOMS or northwest european shelf for NEMO) and time frames from 2006 up to 2049 (NEMO-ERSEM) or 2099 (POLCOMS-ERSEM). Here only the data from POLCOMS-ERSEM is used as it covers a larger domain over a longer time frame. The spatial resolution is  1° x 1° (approximately 11kmx11km) with 43 vertical layers and covers the 2006-2099 period and both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. </p>\n<p><strong>Supporting Information</strong> </p>\n<p>Further information about this application can be found in the <a href=\"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECDE/1.+ECDE+Indicators+visualisation+application%3A+User+Guide\">ECDE application User Guide</a> and the <a href=\"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECDE/2.+ECDE+indicators+and+input+datasets\">Data and datasets underpining the ECDE</a>.\nRelated information can also be found on other sections of the EEA site: \nThe Index based interactive EEA report: Open ocean — ocean chemistry: dissolved oxygen and ocean acidity   (<a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/europes-changing-climate-hazards-1/open-ocean/open-ocean-ocean-chemistry\">link</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Data download</strong></p>\n<p>The aggregated data shown on the map can be <a href=\"https://ecde-data.copernicus-climate.eu/32_ocean_ph_level/32_ocean_ph_level_aggregation.zip\">downloaded</a> as csv files.</p>\n",

no consistent definitions in the literature. Climate indices generally refer to the diagnostic quantity of one or several meteorological and/or hydrological variables including possible thresholds, for different temporal and spatial aggregations (cf. <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2016.06.004'> Kjellström et al., 2016</a>), whereas indicators refer to the function of a variable to represent a phenomenon (cf. <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.08.002'> Hinkel, 2011</a>), such as climate change hazards, impacts or vulnerabilities. Climate indices can be used as indicators to understand phenomena and to support adaptation planning and decision making (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s40322-016-0034-y'>Dubois et al., 2016</a>, <a href='https://gfcs.wmo.int/sites/default/files/Components/Capacity%20Development/GFCS-ANNEXES-CD-FINAL-14143_en.pdf'>WMO, 2014</a>), and in such cases their definitions are the same. However, a climate index is not intuitively or necessarily an indicator.\n                                        </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    \n                                    <h3>Who developed the climate indices of the ECDE?</h3>\n                                        <div>\n                                            The indices available on the ECDE were identified by a selected group of experts that defined publication priorities and presented in a technical report in 2020 (<a href='https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/publications/climate-related-hazard-indices-for-europe-etc-cca-technical-paper-1-2020'>ETC/CCA Technical Paper</a>). The indices were organised according to 16 hazards, grouped into 6 categories consistent with the 'climatic impact drivers' adopted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report.\n                                        </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    \n                                    <h3>To whom are the ECDE indices intended for?</h3>\n                                        <div>\n                                            The primary target audience of the ECDE is the same as Climate-ADAPT: governmental adaptation decision makers at all governance levels in Europe and organisations supporting them.

In this scale, a likely event has a 66%-100% probability of occurrence and corresponds to the 17th-83th percentile range of available values (i.e. leaving out the tails of the distribution). Please note that in most of the ECDE applications only a subset of models is used making the uncertainty evaluation less robust compared to what could be achieved with the full set of climate models.\n                                        </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    \n                                    <h3>Which browsers are supported?</h3>\n                                        <div>\n                                            The European Climate Data Explorer is supported by the most recent versions of the following browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari.
