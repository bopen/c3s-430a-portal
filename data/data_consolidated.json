no consistent definitions in the literature. Climate indices generally refer to the diagnostic quantity of one or several meteorological and/or hydrological variables including possible thresholds, for different temporal and spatial aggregations (cf. <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2016.06.004'> Kjellström et al., 2016</a>), whereas indicators refer to the function of a variable to represent a phenomenon (cf. <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.08.002'> Hinkel, 2011</a>), such as climate change hazards, impacts or vulnerabilities. Climate indices can be used as indicators to understand phenomena and to support adaptation planning and decision making (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s40322-016-0034-y'>Dubois et al., 2016</a>, <a href='https://gfcs.wmo.int/sites/default/files/Components/Capacity%20Development/GFCS-ANNEXES-CD-FINAL-14143_en.pdf'>WMO, 2014</a>), and in such cases their definitions are the same. However, a climate index is not intuitively or necessarily an indicator.\n                                        </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    \n                                    <h3>Who developed the climate indices of the ECDE?</h3>\n                                        <div>\n                                            The indices available on the ECDE were identified by a selected group of experts that defined publication priorities and presented in a technical report in 2020 (<a href='https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/publications/climate-related-hazard-indices-for-europe-etc-cca-technical-paper-1-2020'>ETC/CCA Technical Paper</a>). The indices were organised according to 16 hazards, grouped into 6 categories consistent with the 'climatic impact drivers' adopted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report.\n                                        </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    \n                                    <h3>To whom are the ECDE indices intended for ?</h3>\n                                        <div>\n                                            The primary target audience of the ECDE is the same as Climate-ADAPT: governmental adaptation decision makers at all governance levels in Europe and organisations supporting them.
