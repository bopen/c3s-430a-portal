A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.\n                        </td>\n        \n                        <td >\n                            \n                                <span class=\"link-external\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation\">Source</a></span>\n                            \n                        </td>\n        \n                        <td >\n                            \n                        </td>\n        \n            </tr>    \n        \n            <tr>\n        \n                        <td style=\"white-space: nowrap\">\n                            diapause\n                        </td>\n        \n                        <td >\n                            Diapause is a period of suspended or arrested development during an insect's life cycle, usually as a result of environmental factors.\n                        </td>\n        \n                        <td >\n                            \n                                <span class=\"link-external\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/diapause\">Source</a></span>\n                            \n                        </td>\n        \n                        <td >\n                            \n                        </td>\n        \n            </tr>    \n        \n            <tr>\n        \n                        <td style=\"white-space: nowrap\">\n                            glacial isostatic adjustment\n                        </td>\n        \n                        <td >\n                            Glacial isostatic adjustment is the ongoing movement of land once burdened by ice-age glaciers\n                        </td>\n        \n                        <td >\n                            \n                                <span class=\"link-external\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-6-401-2018\">Source</a></span>\n                            \n                        </td>\n        \n                        <td >\n                            \n                                <span class=\"link-external\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/glacial-adjustment.html\">Source</a></span>\n                            \n                        </td>\n        \n            </tr>    \n         \n    </tbody>\n</table>"
