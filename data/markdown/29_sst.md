**Context**

The Sea Surface Temperature index is relevant for marine ecosystems and fishery. This Index is part of the Ocean temperature type of the Oceanic category of the classification.
The index gives the temperature at the surface of the ocean.  
The higher/lower the value, the higher/lower the temperature.

<br />**Definition**

The Sea Surface Temperature index represents the mean sea surface temperature over different timescales (°C).

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS).
The Index is calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis and a set of 34 earth system models simulations that were interpolated on an identical spatial grid of 1°x1° resolution, and for each of the two emission scenarios: SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5.
More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/projections-cmip6).
